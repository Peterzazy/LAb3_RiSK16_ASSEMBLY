// This code is the optimization of the Q3 special IS1 


LUI 3, 0        // Load 0 into upper 16 bits of R3
MUL 4, 1, 2     // Multiply contents of R1 and R2, result in R4:R5
SW 4, 0(3)      // Store the lower 16 bits of result in R3
SW 5, 2(3)      // Store the upper 16 bits of result in R4

//This code loads 0 into the upper 16 bits of R3,
multiplies the contents of R1 and R2 using the MUL instruction, 
and then stores the lower 16 bits of the result in R3 and the upper 16 bits in R4 using SW instructions. 
This code is more efficient than the previous version as it only uses three instructions to perform the multiplication and storage of the result.
